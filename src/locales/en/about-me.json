  "about_me": "I’ve been active as a DJ since 2011. It all started at GlobalBase.FM, a small webradio station where I took my first steps with the support of a good friend and mentor. A year later came the next milestone with TechLaRocca.FM (founded by, among others, TomTrax) – back then a very well-known station in the webradio scene. In 2014 I switched to NextAge.FM, before a long-standing dream came true in 2015: I became part of RauteMusik.FM, the largest webradio in Europe. From 2015 on, I helped shape the club formats on rm.fm/house (still ongoing) and rm.fm/harder (until 2023) with my own regular shows. Since 2020, I’ve also been part of the program management team at rm.fm/house.",
